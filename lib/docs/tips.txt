+ Sometimes, the model will get confused by your request. If the task fails
  for some reason, try to rephrase it, being as specific as you can. Often
  in this case, it is sufficient to simply repeat the task.

+ When possible, keep each task focused on a particular change. The model
  can get confused about referents (and who wouldn't?) in long sentences
  changing many different aspects of the graph.

+ When you want to change a particular feature, it can be helpful to name it.
  For example, to add a constraint, though it is not always necessary to say
  the word 'constraint', it is often helpful. So start with 'add a constraint
  that...' or 'add constraints so...'. The node names are usually sufficient
  without saying 'node A', but when in doubt adding 'edge', 'node',
  'decoration', and so forth will be more robust.

+ Rarely, the model will forget some part of the graph you had set earlier.
  If it looks like something is missing, you can use the `:transcript`
  command at that point to save a record of your session and then `:undo` to
  move back to the most recent good state.

+ The `autoshow` configuration parameter is useful for letting you inspect the
  changes to your graph and catching if the model does something unexpected. By
  default, `autoshow` will print a (hopefully) relevant summary that connects to
  your most recent task. Another useful setting is your preferred output format,
  letting you see the graph at each step.
