Welcome to GraphMaker, an application that simplifies graph creation. GraphMaker
takes your natural-language instructions and translates them into a graphical
representation, supporting a variety of graph types and styles.

GraphMaker is designed to free the user from fiddling with the specific
positions of nodes or edges; it uses automatic positioning coupled with
user-specified constraints to achieve a Do-What-I-Mean experience.

A quick session:
> make the graph directed
> add nodes A-E
> add edges from node A to C and E
> add edges from node B to D and E

Make sure you have your OpenAI API Key ready. You can obtain one at
https://platform.openai.com and set it in the REPL as  follows:

:config OpenAI.apiKey <your-api-key>

You will see a simple prompt '>' at which you can
enter a *task* for GraphMaker to adjust the current graph
or a *command* that performs a higher-level operation.

Your tasks modify the current graph state maintained by GraphMaker. Use natural
language descriptions like "add three nodes", "make the graph directed", etc.
Refer to entities by names, which are different from assigned labels.

Commands start with ':', the basic ones are :help, :intro, :tips, :examples,
:exit, :show, :save, :load, :reset, :undo, and :redo.

To see the full list of commands, you can use the :help command.
