## Motivation

Graphs &mdash; structures consisting of a set of *nodes* and a set of *edges* between some pairs of nodes &mdash;
are commonly used to depict relationships among entities in many different fields.
While there is a variety of good tools for creating pictures of graphs, the practical reality is that making such
pictures tends to be a fiddly process that often takes far longer than expected.
__GraphMaker__ offers a fluid, natural-language interface for building good pictures of graphs efficiently.
You tell GraphMaker what you want added or changed in the graph, and you can see the result at each stage.
GraphMaker supports a variety of graph types and a wide range of styling options for nodes, edges, and decorative
text and markers.
It can output pictures of the graph in a variety of formats (including SVG, PDF, LaTeX/TikZ, and PNG)
and can save its internal representation (conforming to a JSON schema) so that the graph can be modified
or extended in future sessions.
GraphMaker is designed to free the user from fiddling with the specific positions of nodes or edges; it uses
automatic positioning coupled with user-specified constraints to achieve a Do-What-I-Mean quality.

GraphMaker provides an interactive text REPL along with a library that can be used to provide the same 
functionality in other software.
It uses an AI model for parsing user tasks and can accommodate a variety of models and providers.
 
A session might look like

```
> make the graph directed
As you wish.

> add nodes A-E
Ready for more.

> add edges from node A to C and E
Task complete.

> add edges from node B to D and E
As you wish.

> add constraints that nodes A and B are at the same x coordinate
I've got this.

> add a constraint that C, D, and E are at the same x coordinate 
As you wish.

> add a constraint that A is to the left of C
Stick a fork in me, I'm done.

> make nodes A and B triangles with a fill color of steelblue
As you wish.

> set every node's label to its name
Ready for more.
```

This produces the following graph

## Installation

### Via installation script:

To install or update `graphmaker`, you can run the install script. You may either download and run the script manually, or use one of the following commands:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isle-project/graphmaker/install-graphmaker.sh | bash
```

```bash
wget -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isle-project/graphmaker/install-graphmaker.sh | bash
```

### Via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @isle-labs/graphmaker
```

## Getting Started

Before you start the REPL, make sure you have your OpenAI API Key ready. You can obtain one [here](https://platform.openai.com). Then, you may export it as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

(e.g., in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file). 

Start the REPL from the command line with command

```text
graphmaker 
```

Alternatively, you may pass your API key as an argument to the REPL command:

```bash
graphmaker --apiKey <your-api-key>
```

Last but not least, you can set your API key in the REPL itself:

```text
:config OpenAI.apiKey <your-api-key>
```

You are now ready to start using GraphMaker to create graphs with natural language commands thanks to the power of AI!

You will see a simple prompt '&gt;&nbsp;' at which you can
enter a *task* for GraphMaker to adjust the current graph
or a *command* that performs a higher-level operation.

__Tasks__ are natural language descriptions of a change or addition to the current graph.
GraphMaker maintains the state of the current graph (along with this history of all previous states),
and each task modifies the graph to produce a new graph.
At start up, we begin with an undirected graph with no nodes, edges, or decorations.
A task is a sentence that tells GraphMaker how to adjust the current graph:
`add three nodes`, `make the graph directed`, `add an edge from node A to node B`,
and so forth.
All entities (nodes, edges, decorations) have *names* by which you can refer to them,
names which are distinct from any labels you assign the entities. The names do not
appear in a `:save`'d picture but are visible when you `:show` a picture.
By default, nodes are given alphabetic names in the order they are introduced.
See [Labels and Names](#labels-and-names) below for more detail.
While the models can parse quite complex sentences, it is usually a good idea
to keep your meaning and references as clear as possible.

__Commands__ start with ':', the basic ones are
`:help`, `:intro`, `:tips`, `:examples`, 
`:exit`, `:show`, `:save`, `:load`,
`:reset`, `:undo`, and `:redo`.
To see the full list of commands, you can use `:help` from
within the repl or use the `--help` flag on the command line:

```text
graphmaker --help
```

```
@PROCESS-OUTPUT(usage-help, ./bin/cli)
```

The full set of commands is described in detail in the [REPL Capabilities](#repl-capabilities) section.

### Example Session 1

In this session, we build a simple, undirected graph with some basic styling and labels.
GraphMaker's responses have been omitted for clarity.

```
> add seven nodes
> add a style "left" to nodes A, B, C 
> add a style "right" to nodes D, E, F, G
> define the style left to have node shape square, fill color blue, and line width thick
> define the style right to have node shape triangle, fill color tomato, and fill style hashed vertical
> add constraints that make all nodes with the same style tag have the same horizontal coordinate
> add a constraint that node A is to the left of node D
> add edges from A to D, F, and G
> add edges from B to E and F
> add edges from C to E and G
```

### Example Session 2

In this session, we build a finite automaton, where states are represented by nodes
and transitions by edges labeled with the input.
GraphMaker's responses have been omitted for clarity.

```
> make the graph directed
> add nodes A-G
> add constraints that each of nodes A-E is to the left of its successor and has the same y-coordinate
> add a constraint that node F is above node A and has x-coordinate centered on those of nodes A-E
> add a constraint that node G is below node A and has x-coordinate centered on those of nodes A-E
> set the fill color for node E to green
> set the fill color for node F to red and the fill style to crosshatched
> set the label for node A to be "Start"
> add an edge from A to B with label "0" and with angle leaving and entering -45
> add an edge from A to G with label "1"
> add an edge from G to itself with label 1 and loop direction -90
> add an edge from G to E with label "0"
> add an edge from B to C with label "0" and edge from B to F with label "1"
> add an edge from C to D with label "0" and edge from C to itself with label "1" and loop direction -90
> add an edge from D to E with label "0" and an edge from D to F with label "1"
> :save ./automaton.svg
```

At each stage, you can see the graph being built and then can save it in a variety of formats.
Adding the edges one at a time might be tiresome in a large graph, so we can specify them all
at once. Here is an alternative version of the previous session that is more compact:

```
> make the graph directed
> add seven nodes
> add constraints that each of nodes A-E is to the left of its successor and has the same y-coordinate
> add constraints that nodes F and G have x-coordinates centered on those of nodes A-E
> add constraints that F is above node A and that G is below node A
> set the fill color for node E to green and for node F to red and give F a fill style of crosshatched
> set the label for node A to be "Start"
> :multiline
Add edges for the following adjacency matrix, ordered A-G
  0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1
  0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0
  0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
  0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0
  0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1
^D
> :multiline
Add labels to the edges as follows
  A to B "0", A to G "1"
  B to C "0", B to F "1"
  C to D "0", C to C "1"
  D to E "0", D to F "1"
  G to E "0", G to G "1"
^D
> set the loop direction to -90 for the self loops at nodes C and G
> set the angle leaving and entering to -45 for the edges with source A
> :save ./automaton2.svg
```

Here, the "^D" represents a Control-D character that is used to end the multi-line input.


## Usage

### Conventions

GraphMaker tracks three kinds of entities: nodes, edges, and decorations.
Nodes and edges are components of the graph, as expected. Decorations represent
either arbitrary text strings or rectangular regions that are used to demarcate
and label parts of the graph.
Every entity has a name that is used to refer to it when building the graph.
This name appears on the draft pictures of the graph but not in the saved
production picture.
By default, nodes are given alphabetic names (like A, B, C)
and edges are named like AB or AC for the nodes they connect,
but you can specify the names as you prefer.
The next section discusses this in detail.

Every node, edge, and decoration has several properties that can be set by
the user. For instances, nodes and edges have an optional label; edges
have an optional numeric weight; and both can have associated data
as key-value pairs. Edges specify a source node and a target node;
the distinction is only visible if the edge is directed, but it is
maintained in the names and underlying data.

GraphMaker keeps track of the current graph being bulid and the
entire history of changes you make to the graph from the beginning
of the session. You can move through that history, reset the graph
to its initial state, or load a saved graph from a file. When you
enter a task into GraphMaker, you are describing a change to the
current graph. You can view that graph at anytime with the `:show`
command.

### Labels and Names

GraphMaker assigns a name to every node, edge, and decoration.
These names allow the user to refer to the entity in a task and
are distinct from the *labels* that one might add to the picture.
Each name must be unique within the graph.
However, the user need not think of names for everything;
by default, GraphMaker will assign simple and memorable names to nodes and edges
as they are added to the graph.
Default names for nodes are alphabetic labels A, B, C, ...;
and default names for edges are strings like AB, CD, XY comprised of
the names of the nodes being connected (in order from source to target
in the directed case).
If you prefer different names, you can indicate that to GraphMaker 
when you construct the entity. For example:

```
> add nodes "Parent", "Child 1", "Child 2", and "Child 3"
> add an edge "Oldest" from Parent to Child 1
> add an edge "Youngest" from Parent to Child 3
> add a text decoration Title with text "Family Tree" centered just below the top of the canvas
```

Names are only shown on the graph in draft mode during the REPL session
(displayed in a shaded gray color)
and will not be included in the saved output.
(By default, the `:show` command produces pictures in draft mode, though this can be changed 
with the `:config` command. Output produced by the `:save` command has draft mode off.)

In contrast to names, *labels* are arbitrary strings attached to nodes and edges
to be displayed in the graph output.
Labels can be styled in various fonts, sizes, colors, weights, and styles;
they can also include mathematical text in LaTeX.
Labels can be set when a node is added

```
> add nodes A, B, and C with labels "Start", "Middle", and "End"
```

or at any point afterwards

```
> set the label of node Z to "Accept"
```

Labels can include any text, including spaces and unicode characters. 
You can also instruct Graphmaker to treat the label as a mathematical equation,
in either LaTeX or [MathLingo](attn) format.
To do this, you specify the type of label and give the value; no delimiters ($, $$, &Backslash;&lpar;, &Backslash;&lsqb;)
should be included.
For example:

```
> add a node with LaTeX label of \chi^2(\alpha)
> add a node with mathlingo label e to the minus x squared over two
```

You can also set the label of an edge:

```
> add an edge from A to B with label "Shortcut"
```

The label text can be styled with a variety of parameters.

```
> add a node A with label "Pass Go"
> set the font size for A's label to 20, its weight to bold, and its color to tomato
```


See [Style Details](#style-details) for more on the style parameters
supported for text. These parameters can also be set in defined styles that can
be applied to any entity:

```
> define a style salient with font size 20, font color tomato, and font weight bold
> add the style salient to node A and edge AB
```


### Graph Types

Graphmaker has explicit support for several graph types.

You can tell it explicitly to make a graph undirected (no arrows on edges) or directed (arrows on edges).
By default, graphs are initialized as *undirected*.

```
> make this graph directed
```

(Note that individual edges can be made undirected, directed, or bidirected, regardless of the
graph's specified type. The graphs type becomes the default for an edge.)

Graphmaker specially handles trees and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), which are typically
displayed in a form consistent with their structure.
To create a tree or DAG, you need to specify a __parent relation__ between
nodes:

```
> node A is a parent of node B
```

This implies that there is an edge from A to B and that A is a predecessor
of B. When there are parent relations in the graph, GraphMaker checks if the
graph constitutes a tree or DAG.
If the resulting graph (excluding self-loops) forms a tree, GraphMaker
will format the graph accordingly. Otherwise, if there are parent relations and
no cycles, it will format the graph as a DAG.

Both trees and DAGs have a default layout orientation. The `orientation` config option
sets this. By default, it is `auto` which causes trees to be displayed from the top
down, with the root at the top and DAGs to be displayed left-to-right with the
earliest nodes (with no predecessors) at the left.  The `orientation` option can be
set to `top` (top down), `bottom` (bottom up), `left` (left-to-right), or `right` (right-to-left)
as desired.  For general graphs, this option is used only in the initial positioning of the
nodes in the order defined.

GraphMaker is not limited to simple graphs. You can define multiple edges between two nodes,
which will have distinct names and properties. You can also define edges from a node to itself (self-loops).
When defining multiple edges between nodes, it is helpful to indicate that this edge should be
distinct. For example:

```
> add an edge from A to B
> add another distinct edge from A to B
> add three distinct edges from C to itself
```

Graphmaker can also support other specialized graph forms, such as bipartite and complete graphs.
To generate a complete graph, try

```
> give me a complete graph on six nodes
```

You can also be more direct to the same effect:

```
> add six nodes
> add an edge between each distinct pair of nodes
```

For bipartite graphs, it is often most effective to set style tags
on the nodes to determine their class

```
> add nodes A-G
> add a style tag 'bluebird' to nodes A-D
> add a style tag 'chickadee' to nodes E-G
> define the style 'bluebird' to have square shape and fill color blue
> define the style 'chickadee' to have fill color brown
> add constraints that make all nodes with the same style tag have the same horizontal coordinate
> add edges from A to F and G and from B to E and from C to E, F, and G
```

### Node Properties

To create our graph, one will often start by creating nodes. Each node has a name, an optional label,
several ways to specify how that node is styled, and several properties that can be customized.
The supported properties are:

  + __Node Shape__ 

    Graphmaker supports various shapes for nodes: `circle` (default), `ellipse`, `rectangle`, `square`, `diamond`, `triangle`, and `invisible`.
    (Of course, circles are ellipses and squares are rectangles, but all of them are valid.) An `invisible` node displays no shape, but its labels
    (and names in draft mode) are displayed.

    You can change the shape of a node by telling GraphMaker directly
    
    ```
    > make node A a triangle
    > make nodes B, C, and D a diamond
    ```

    You can also create a node with a shape from the outset

    ```
    > add a diamond node
    ```

    Node shapes can also be set more generally using `style` tags and `data` attributes as described below.
    This can be more efficient when there are multiple nodes whose shape needs to be set or changed.

  + __Node Width To Height__ 

    This is a *positive number* that specifies the aspect ratio of the node's shape (more precisely, the shape's bounding box).
    The default value is 1.

  + __Node Size__ 

    This is a scaling factor that determines a node's size relative to the default (with value 1).
    Note that in the pictures that are produced, the base node size *on the canvas* depends weakly on
    the number of nodes in the graph.

  + __Label Offset__
  
    The label offset determines where a node's label (if any) is displayed relative to
    the center of the node. For nodes, offset distances are in units of the node's size
    (exactly analogous to the Node Size parameter).

    The offset can be specified in various forms

    - `none`: the label will be anchored at the center of the node. This is the default.
    
    - A cardinal direction (`north`, `northeast`, `east`, `southeast`, `south`, `southwest`, `west`, `northwest`):
      the label will be offset by one unit from the center of the node in the specified direction.
      
    - A cardinal direction with a distance: the label will be offset
      from the center of the node by the given distance (in units of
      node size) in the given direction. For example,

      ```
      > set the label offset for A to northeast by 1.5
      ```

      will anchor A's label to the top right of the node by one and a half node radii.

    - Two numbers `dx, dy` representing offsets in units of node size in the direction (dx, dy).
      For example

      ```
      > set the label offset for A to 1, -1
      ```

      will anchor the label at the bottom right corner of a box surrounding the node.

  + __Node Style__ 

    We can associate one or more *style tags* with a node. 
    A style tag is just an arbitrary name that will be (separately)
    associated with a set of styling parameter settings.

    We can change or set the style tags associated with the node
    by telling GraphMaker to add that name as an associated style:

    ```
    > add a style 'leaf' to nodes A, D, and F
    > add a style 'branch' to nodes B, C, E, and G
    ```

    At this point, `leaf` and `branch` are just tags, but they
    are assigned meaning by *defining a style* with that name.
    A style is an assignment of one or more styling parameters
    and can also include node and edge properties

    ```
    > define the style 'leaf' to have fill color gray and node shape square
    > define the style 'branch' to have line color steel blue and node shape ellipse with width twice the height
    ```

    Now we can reconfigure the style for multiple nodes in one step.
    
    ```
    > change the node shape in the style 'leaf' to be ellipse
    ```

    A node may have more than one style tag. All of them apply, and styles later in the list take
    precedence.
    
    ```
    > define the style 'special' to have fill color green
    > add the style 'special' to node A
    ```

    Now node A will be a green square.

  + __Data Attributes__

    One can associate with a node a set of arbitrary data, specified as key-value pairs.
    These data can be used in GraphMaker both to /select/ nodes in a task and also to
    set values and styles.
  
    ```
    > add nodes A-D
    > for A and C add data role 'admin'
    > for B and D add data role 'user'
    > add an edge from each node with admin role to each node with user role
    > add constraints that make all nodes with the same role data have the same vertical coordinate
    > add a constraint that A is below B
    ```

In addition, one can set any individual styling parameters for the node, such as fill style or line color.
Any individual style parameter set for the node overrides the effect of a style tag. For example:

```
> add nodes A-C
> add a style 'foo' to nodes A and C
> define the style 'foo' to have fill color blue and fill style of vertical hashing
> set the fill color for node A to be 'tomato'
```
Now A and C both inherit the style 'foo' but A's fill color has been changed.

As mentioned earlier, more than one style can be added to a node

```
> append a second style 'bar' to node A
> define the style 'bar' to have line color red and line width thick
```

See the section [Style Details](#style-details) for details on the supported styling parameters and their values.


### Edge Properties

Edges in the graph are the connections between nodes. Each edge has
a source and target, specified implicitly when defining the edge.
You can create an edge between nodes A and B simply by saying
something like

```
> create an undirected edge between A and B
```

or 

```
> create a directed edge from A to B
```

By default, edges in a graph are undirected. To make all edges directed, you can say

```
> make this graph directed
```

It is also possible to create an edge from a node to itself (a self-loop) by saying something like

```
> add an edge from A to itself
```

As with nodes, edges have an optional label that can be set in the same way
(including LaTeX and mathlingo formats).
Also as with nodes, edges can have zero or more style tags,
and you can set individual styling parameters for a particular edge, which will
override the values of parameters set in a style.
(Again, see the section [Style Details](#style-details) for help on those parameters.)

You can use the (implicitly defined) source and target properties of edges to
select edges during tasks.

```
> set the line width to thick for all edges whose source is node A
> set the line color to blue and line style dotted for all edges whose target is node C
```
In addition, edges have several specialized properties of an edge
that can be set to customize its appearance and behavior in the
graph.

  + __Label Offset__

    The label offset determines where a edge's label (if any) is displayed relative to
    the center of the edge. For edges, offset distances are in units of the edge's size,
    with -1 corresponding to the source end and 1 corresponding to the target end.

    The offset can be specified in various forms

    - `none`: the label will be anchored at the center of the edge. This is the default.
    
    - An *relative* cardinal direction (`north`, `northeast`, `east`, `southeast`, `south`, `southwest`, `west`, `northwest`):
      the label will be offset by one unit from the center of the edge in the specified direction *relative to the edge's direction*
      (i.e., the line between source and target translated to the edge center).
      
    - An *absolute* cardinal direction (`up`, `up right`, `right`, `down right`, `down`, `down left`, `left`, `up left`):
      the label will be offset by one unit in the specified direction (relative to the canvas) from the center of the edge.
      
    - A cardinal direction (relative or absolute) with a distance: the label will be offset from the by the given distance (in units of
      edge size) in the given direction. For example,

      ```
      > set the label offset for AB to northeast by 1.5
      > set the label offset for BC to down right by 1.5
      ```

    - Two numbers `dx, dy` representing offsets in units of edge size in the direction (dx, dy)
      *relative to the edge direction*.
      For example,

      ```
      > set the label offset for AB to 0.75, 0.05
      ```

      will anchor the label three quarters of the way from the center to the target end
      and slightly above.

  + __Weight__ 
  
    An optional numeric value associated with the edge. It is often
    used to represent the *strength* or *cost* of the connection
    between two nodes. The weight of an edge is displayed as a separate label
    on the edge. The weight of an edge can be set when the edge is
    created or later. For example:
   
    ```
    > create an edge from A to B with weight 3
    ```
    
    ```
    > set the weight of the edge AB to 11
    ```

  + __Weight Offset__
  
    Weight offset is handled and specified exactly the same way that label offset is,
    except that the weight is displayed on the other side of the edge (e.g., bottom vs. top)
    as the label.

  + __Loop Direction__

    For self loops, you may explicitly specify a loop direction, which
    defines the angle at which a self-loop edge points to the node. The
    loop direction is defined as a numeric value giving the
    counter-clockwise angle from the positive x-direction. For example:
     
    ```
    > create a directed edge from A to itself with loop direction 45
    ```
     
    The loop direction can also be set later:
     
    ```
    > set the loop direction of the edge AA to 45
    ```

  + __Angle Leaving__ and __Angle Entering__
     
      By default, an edge between two nodes is displayed as a line (maybe with arrows)
      from source to target. But sometimes it is desirable for the edges
      to be curved. The __angle leaving__ and __angle entering__ parameters determine
      the angle (relative to a straight line) at which the edge *leaves the source*
      and *enters the target* respectively. When these values are non-zero, the edge
      is displayed as a cubic Bezier curve; the angles are 0 by default, giving linear
      edges.  The values are used so that the same sign leaving and entering indicates
      a curve toward the same side of a linear edge. For example,

      ```
      > set the angle leaving and entering to 45
      ```

      gives an edge that arcs to the left of the line between source and target,
      with a 45 degree angle between the curve at beginning and end and
      that line.

    + __Softness Leaving__ and __Softness Entering__

      The softness parameters can be used to adjust the curvature of a curved
      edge near the source (softness *leaving*) and the target (*softness entering*).
      The softness is a non-negative number with a default of 0.5; typical values are
      between 0 and 1, with 1 having more pronounced curvature.
      
### Decorations

Decorations are graphical elements in saved picture that are *not* part of the graph.
Graphmaker supports three kinds of decorations:

+ Text

  Text decorations specify strings or paragraphs that are added to the picture
  at designated locations. A text decoration can be configured with any styling
  parameters that affect text (e.g., font color, font size, font style, font weight,
  font variant). It also accepts two specialized properties that affect how the
  text is displayed:

  - __Text Anchor__ (values: `start`, `middle`, `end`, `top`, `bottom`; default: `middle`)
  
    This indicates the point in the string of text is at the specified position
    of the decoration. For multi-line text, an additional `top` or `bottom` can be
    supplied to specify the vertical component of the anchor. Thus, `start top` anchors
    in the top-left corner of a paragraph; `middle top` in the middle of the top line.
    A `top` or `bottom` have no effect on single lined text.

  - __Text Justify__ (values: `left`, `right`, `center`, `none`, `list`; default: `none`)

    This indicates how a multi-lined text paragraph is justified. The value `list`
    puts each line on its own like a bulleted list with no bullets.


  The position of a text decoration can be specified in two ways. The first of these
  is more more flexible and useful.
  
  1. Alignment Constraints

     You can specify optional expressions (as with node position constraints) for the x (horizontal)
     and y (vertical) coordinates of the text anchor relative to nodes or edges in
     the graph. These are often given explicitly. For example:

     ```
     > add a text decoration "tip" with text "This is where we start"
     > align the decoration "tip" at the midpoint of nodes A and B
     ```

     You can give different conditions on the x and y coordinates of the anchor in this way.
     You can align relative to the center of the nodes or to the north, north east, east, ..., north west
     corners of the bounding boxes of those nodes. For example:

     ```
     > align the x coordinate of decoration "warning" to the north east of node A
     > align the y coordinate of decoration "warning" to the south of node B
     > align the decoration "big warning" at the average coordinates of nodes D, E, and F
     ```

  2. Absolute Position

     You can specify x, y coordinates for the text anchor, where x (horizontal)
     and y (vertical) positions are both between 0 and 1. So, 0, 0 is the bottom
     left corner of the canvas; and 1,1 is the top right corner of the canvas.

     As the name suggests, absolutely positioned text will not move if the
     graph is repositioned.

+ Regions

  Region decorations depict rectangular areas on the canvas and are typically used
  to demarcate or otherwise highlight particular parts of the graph. For example,
  in graphical models *plates* are rectangles around one or more nodes indicating
  a repeated substructure.

  As with nodes and edges, each region is given a name so the user can refer to it
  when giving tasks. The name does not appear in the output. If no name is specified,
  it will set automatically (typically to `region1`, `region2`, ...). You can see
  the details on all defined regions with the `:show decorations` command at the
  repl prompt.

  Adding a region decoration requires specifying a width and hight and an x, y position.
  As with text, the coordinates can each be specified in two ways:

  1. Alignment Constraints

     A region decoration can be set to *align with* or to *contain* specified nodes. 
     For example:

     ```
     add a region decoration "plate" that contains nodes A and B
     add a region decoration "blurb"
     align the x-coordinates of blurb's northwest corner and node C
     align blurb's northwest corner three node sizes below node C
     give blurb a width and height of 0.25
     ```

  2. Absolute Coordinates
     We can specify a regions x and y coordinates with (0,0) being the lower
     left corner of the canvas and (1, 1) being the upper right corner.

  In addition to the coordinates, we can specify the region's width and height
  on a scale from 0 to 1 (canvas width or height, respectively). A constraint
  that a region contains one or more nodes will override this width; more specifically,
  the region will be as close as possible to the stated width and height consistent
  with any containment constraints.

  Finally, you can specify styling parameters for regions, including defined styles
  fillColor, fillStyle, lineColor, lineWidth, and lineStyle.

+ Arrows

  Arrow decorations add arrows to the picture that are not edges in the graph.
  By default, the arrows are styled to look different than edges, and those
  styles can be configured. To specify an arrow decoration, you need to give

  1. Positions of the start and end. As with texts and regions, these positions
     can be specified absolutely or through alignment constraints (or a mixture).
  2. Arrowhead styles for the start and end. By default, an arrow decoration has an
     arrowhead on the end and none on the start, but this can be modified to any
     of the four possibilities. Arrow styles are listed in the styling details.
     (ATTN: For the moment, only one arrowhead style is supported.)
  3. Optional styling parameters, including defined styles, lineWidth, lineColor,
     and lineStyle.

### Styling

Graphmaker supports a variety of styling parameters for nodes, edges, and decorations.
See [Style Details](#style-details) for details on these parameters.

In addition, you can define *named styles*, which are tags that have associated settings
of one or more styling parameters. You can then apply zero or more named styles to any
entity, effectively setting its styling parameters. The advantage of named styles is that
they help apply a consistent look to multiple entities at once and can easily be changed
as desired. If more than one named style defines the same styling parameter, the style
first specified in the style list takes precedence.

Individual style parameters set on an entity take precedence over any settings in a named
style applied to that entity. In this way, you can make large scale styling decisions and
adjust or specialize the styling for particular needs.

Graphmaker attempts to make the settings of style parameters as consistent as possible
across output formats, but there may be slight variations across formats.

### Constraints

Graphmaker's philosophy is to make it easy to incrementally build up a graph and save
it in multiple formats, with an option of continuing later to modify or adjust it.
It tries to do what you mean with a minimum of specification, but this may require 
some fine tuning to get exactly the shape you want. The use of AI model, while powerful 
and flexible, adds some inevitable variation to the result that may also require
adjustment.

An effective practice is to add your nodes and edges as desired and then add constraints
on the nodes (and decorations). Node constraints can specify linear relationships among
node positions (relative to specified anchors). The AI model can translate natural language
for constraints into reasonably accurate forms, making the constraints relatively easy to
specify. For example,

```
Add constraints that puts node C at the average position of all other nodes
```

will generate two constraints, one on the x-coordinate of node C and one on its y-coordinate.
Similar constraints, like `Add a constraint that C is at the midpoint of A and B` or 
`Add a constraint that C is above B`, or `Add a constraint that A and B are at the same horizontal coordinate`
express the relationships in simple and intuitive terms.

Note that we often start constraint tasks with `Add constraints that` or `Add a constraint that`.
While not strictly necessary, this helps the model interpret the task correctly.

By default, constraints on the node position will use the node's center point as the relevant
anchor. However, you can specify instead a point on the boundary of the node's bounding box
by giving a cardinal direction (north, north east, east, south east, south, south west, west, north west):

```
add a constraint that the x coordinate of C at the north west equals that of B at the south east
```

will horizontally align the upper left of C with the lower right of B. You can also use "center" as an explicit
anchor if you need to specify precisely or change from a different value.

Constraints can be specified as equalities or inequalities. For instance, a constraint that `A is below B` 
indicates that A's y-coordinate is less than or equal to B's y-coordinate.  Inequality constraints can go
in either direction (greater or less).

When working with constraints at the repl, the `:reposition` command can be useful. Graphmaker solves for
a good arrangement of your nodes and edges, adjusting incrementally as new structure is added to the graph.
So that the graph remains stable as you proceed, Graphmaker uses the previous positions as starting points
for repositioning nodes after adjustment. Sometimes, however, you have made sufficient changes that you
do not want to be bound by the earlier positions. The `:reposition` command clears saved positions and
gives a fresh solution. Adding constraints can sometimes be more effective after this command.

In addition to node position constraints, you can also put some mild constraints on decorations. These
are applied *after* the nodes are positioned, not concurrently. You can specify that a decoration be
aligned with a node (relative to anchors for each) or that a region decoration should contain one or
more particular nodes.

Finally, if you specify parent-child relationships between nodes (which imply an edge), then Graphmaker
will use that information to adjust the graph layout accordingly. For instance, parent relations are used
to detect if the graph is a tree, or forest of trees, or directed acyclic graph, yielding a more approriate
layout.

### Graph Output

Graphmaker supports multiple output formats: SVG, LaTeX/TeX, PDF, PNG, JPG, GIF, TIFF, WEBP,
and JSON. The LaTeX/TikZ format produces a complete LaTeX file that can be processed to
show the picture. The picture is in an isolated `tikzpicture` environment and can thus
be extracted into any other LaTeX file. (Note that a few package/library inclusions are
required as indicated in the output file.) The JSON format is a data-representation of the
graph that Graphmaker stores to record the state of the current graph. The saved JSON
output can be loaded into Graphmaker to continue or modify the existing graph.

At the repl, the default format can be determined and changed using the `:config` command
(with key `format`). The default default format is SVG. These files can be opened and viewed
in any modern browser.

The `:save` command is used to save the current picture to a file in a specified format.
This can be run any number of times with different formats. The `:show` command shows
you the current graph in a way based on the format given.  (For example, :showing an
SVG file will cause the picture to be displayed in a browswer automatically.) Both
JSON and TeX/LaTeX/TikZ formats are text-based and will be displayed to the terminal
on a `:show` command. Note that the `:show` command might display slightly less information
than is saved to make the output more readable. See the next subsection for further details.

### REPL Capabilities

The Graphmaker repl provides an environment for interactively building your graph and
saving pictures in various formats. The repl has a built-in help system, a complete command history,
command and file completion (with TAB), and a variety of commands to improve the experience.

#### Help

There are several ways to get help from within the repl: the `:help`, `:examples`, `:intro`, and `:tips` commands.
The `:intro` and `:tips` commands provide some tutorial documentation. The `:examples` command let's you interactively
view the tasks and output from a gallery of examples. 

The `:help` command answers free-form questions about the system, parameters, and commands.  For example:

```
> :help how does the :help command work
The `:help` command is used to get information about the available commands, parameters, and functionalities. When the `:help` command is used, the system will provide a response containing a description of the command or parameter and how it can be used. This helps users understand how to interact with the system and make use of its features effectively. The response will be in the form of a text description and may also include examples or additional details to provide further clarification.
```

A bit chatty, but often useful. This is especially useful for finding details about the styling parameters,
which can be hard to remember.

```
> :help what are valid values for the line width
Valid values for the line width can be one of the following: "very-thin", "thin", "medium", "thick", or "very-thick".
```

If given without any text, `:help` will give a summary of available commands. If given a single word, it will
use that as a topic to look up relevant documentation on that word.

#### History

You can scroll through your command/task history from the repl, extending across the current session
and earlier sessions. Use Up-arrow or Control-p to move to earlier commands; and Down arrow or Control-n
to move to later commands. You can edit the visible command and hit enter to submit your edited text.

The history is stored in the file `.graphmaker_history` in the user's home directory.
The `:history` command will display the history; if given an integer argument `n`, it will
show the most recent `n` history items.

The `:transcript` command will save all the commands and tasks from the *current session* to a specified file.
You can edit it or `:exec` it to reproduce your session.

The `:undo` and `:redo` move through your history, changing the current graph to past and future states.
If after undo-ing you make changes, then the future history is eliminated.

#### Tab Completion

When you hit TAB, the repl will attempt to complete the current command name, file name, or other command argument.
Hit TAB once to complete as far as possible. If there is ambiguity, only a partial command will be shown; then
hit TAB again to see a list of possible matches.

#### Notable Configuration Settings

The `:config` command let's you examine and set a variety of pre-specified configuration parameters that 
determine how Graphmaker works. See the help for `:config` for all the details. Here, we highlight a few
that are use and possible to overlook.

The `autoshow` configuration parameter can be used to display the current graph after each task.
By default, the `autoshow` parameter is set to deduce what summary to display from the most recent task.
It can be set to show particular aspect of the graph (graph, nodes, edges, decorations, constraints, data)
that will produce a text summary of that aspect. Or it can be set to an output format (svg, png, jpg, jpeg, pdf,
json, tex, latex) in which case a picture of the graph will be produced as by the `:show`` command.

The `format` configuration parameter determines the default output format if not supplied to `:show`.

The `orientation` configuration parameter determines the default display orientation for graphs (especially trees, forests, and
DAGS). It can be set to `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, or `auto`, with the latter attempting to deduce the best orientation
from the graph structure (e.g., `top` for trees with root on top; `left` for DAGS with initial node on left).

You can also set the `width` and `height` of the display canvas

Finally, the AI model `provider` configuration is a name that references a configuration parameter with special structure
that is associated with the currently active AI model. For example, if there is an `openai` configuration parameter, it will
be a structure recording the api key, the specific model, and various provider-specific parameters. When `provider`
is set to `openai`, those parameters will be in effect. You can change the provider and you can change the parameters
for a specific provider independently. For example, to change your api key for openai, you would use the command `:config openai.apiKey NEW-KEY-HERE`.
You can do this for any provider even if it is not active. Use `:config provider NEW-PROVIDER` to change the currently active provider.

#### Convenience Commands

The `:show` command has several related uses. When given a graph format (or no arguments in which case the default format is used),
this command displays the current graph -- in draft mode -- to the user. The medium of display depends on the format.
For example, SVG format is displayed in a new tab in your default browser; PDF format opens a pdf viewer; image formats
like PNG or GIF open an image viewer with the picture, and latex and json formats are displayed to the terminal as text.
In addition, you can use the `:show` command to display various summaries of the graph in textual form at the repl.

The `:exec` and `:exec-batch` commands will load and run a file containing commands or tasks. The former
executes each command/task one at a time; the latter executes them all at once. Both commands accept some
prefix and suffix text which is wrapped around the contents of the file.
You can for instance `:exec` the file saved by the `:transcript` command.

The `:load` command lets you read a saved graph from its `.json` file. This overwrites the current graph and resets
the chat history (though not the command history). The `:reset` command does the same reset, starting with a fresh graph.
The `:reposition` command forgets saved positions of the nodes, which can be useful for improving layout after many small changes.

## The GraphMaker Node Library

While the GraphMaker repl is a convenient medium for interactive graph building, it can be useful to
build GraphMaker functionality into other apps or pages. For this purpose, GraphMaker can also be
used as a Javascript or Typescript library. 

Once you initialize your graph and your ai model, you issue a series of asynchronous *updates*
that return a new graph state and maybe output as well, depending on the specific update
provided. Updates include running a task, resetting the graph, and much more. It is relatively
straightforward to provide functionality like the repl in another context this way.
(Indeed, the repl is build just like this.)

### Installation

```bash
npm install @isle-labs/graphmaker
```

### Usage

```javascript
const GraphMaker = require( '@isle-labs/graphmaker' );

const state = GraphMaker.initializeGraph( config );

const oracle = GraphMaker.aiFactory( 'openai' );

// Update the graph with a natural language prompt:
const [ newState, output ] = await GraphMaker.updateGraph( state, GraphMaker.task( 'Add a node A', oracle ) );

// Export the graph in various formats:
const [ _, svgOutput ] = await GraphMaker.updateGraph (state, GraphMaker.save({ format: 'svg' }) );
```

### API

#### .initializeGraph(config)

Initializes a new graph state with the given configuration options.

##### Arguments

-   `config`: configuration options

##### Returns

The initial graph state


#### .aiFactory(provider, {type, model, apiKey})

Creates an AI instance for generating directed and undirected graphs that match a specified JSON schema. The AI instance will be responsible for ensuring that nodes, edges, and properties are set correctly according to the schema.

##### Arguments

-   `provider`: the AI provider to use (currently only supports 'openai')
-   `options`: the options for the AI instance
    -   `options.type`: the type of AI instance to create (supports `'streaming'` or `'single'`)
    -   `options.model`: the AI model to use (currently only supports `'gpt-3.5-turbo'` and `'gpt-4'`)
    -   `options.apiKey`: the API key to use for the model provider

##### Returns

-   A function that takes a user prompt and an object containing the current graph state and history, and returns a Promise that resolves to the updated graph state according to the AI's interpretation of the prompt.

#### .updateGraph(state, {action, payload})

Updates the graph state based on the action and payload. The following actions are available:

-   `'TASK'`: Change the graph according to a user's prompt

    -   `options.action`: the action to perform
    -   `options.payload`: the payload of the action

#### .task(prompt, oracle)

Returns a command to change a graph according to a user's `prompt`. The AI model passed as an `oracle` (e.g., a function returned from `aiFactory`) will interpret the prompt and perform the desired action, such as adding or removing nodes or edges, or changing properties of the graph elements.

##### Arguments

-   `prompt`: the prompt to update the graph with
-   `oracle`: the oracle to use for the prompt 

#### .setGraph(graph)

Returns a command to set the graph to a given graph.

##### Arguments

-   `graph`: the graph to set

Returns a command to redo the last undone command on the graph.

#### .undo()

Returns a command to undo the last command on the graph.

#### .save(config)

Returns a command to save the graph in a given format.

##### Arguments

-   `config`: the graph config payload
    -   `config.format`: the format to save the graph in (defaults to 'json'). Possible values are: 'svg', 'pdf', 'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif', 'webp', 'tiff', 'tikz', and 'json'.
    -   `config.draft`: whether to save the graph as a draft (defaults to false)
