Library that takes a series of commands and returns a State that is up

init() -> initial-state for a new graph
update(State, Command) -> (State, Maybe Output)


Command = Prompt String | Undo | Redo | Export Format
Format = SVG | PNG | PDF | ... | Internal   (SVG is the default)
Output = Error String | Graph String | ...
State = { graph, history: Array<HistoryElement> }   // Preferred conceptually
HistoryElement = { graph, prompt, exported?, ...}
// State = Array<HistoryElement>   // Alternative, current graph is last

Task: Write a small library implementing the above interface.


Web UI, REPL interface,

JSON schema validation, OpenAI requests, 

immer  for the GraphState ?

# Library API

 initializeGraph() -> GraphState
 updateGraph(GraphState, Command) -> (GraphState, Result<GraphOutput>)

# Command generates
 task(prompt: String) -> Command
 undo() -> Command
 redo() -> Command
 export(format: String) -> Command

Command 
{ type: 'export', payload: 'svg | png | pdf | json' }
{ type: 'task', payload: 'userPrompt' }
{ type: 'redo', payload: null }
{ type: 'undo', payload: null }



# Hit export button or enter "export png" at the repl
 updateGraph(state, export("png")) -> (state', Some<PNGFile>)

updateGraph for task:
1) injects the user prompt into our template
2) call OpenAI API with the constructed prompt
3) parse the response and validates it against the JSON schema
4) updates the graph state with the new graph and the updated history
5) returns (GraphState,None)

# Move positioning from toSVG to the save function

-   if any position is missing, reposition all the nodes except for those that are fixed; otherwise, refine the positions using the existing positions as a starting point

# TODO

-  [ ] clean-up the code
-  [ ] add label styling for nodes and edges including position offsets and fonts
-  [ ] check support for named styles
-  [ ] add export to PNG, PDF, SVG, and tikz
-  [ ] add support for non-linear edges
-  [ ] add support for decorations (freely positioned rectangles and texts)
-  [ ] add support for other node shapes 
-  [ ] add automatic retries and error handling
