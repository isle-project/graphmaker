# The use of prefix and suffix with the :exec command works in general.
# You need to use '', "", or `` as delimiters on the prefix and suffix if the strings
# have spaces in them.
# This file is not meant to be :exec'd but rather to show what :exec command you
# would use at the repl to produce the graph. See also load-adjacency-matrix example.
